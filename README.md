<Code-Refactor>

## Objective
This goal of this assignment is to learn how to refactor code and push our HTML to our GitHub Repository.

## Project Actions
I learned to clean up the syntax and reduce clutter of the HTML and CSS Files by grouping classes more efficiently. I also added the <nav> tag to allow users to navigate to sections of the page.

Lastly, this HTML file was pushed to GitHub through utilizing VSCODE's terminal and creating a repository on our GitHub.

## Resources Utilized
Outside of the lessons taught in class, w3schools.com was used to identify necessary HTML and CSS elements and formatting.
